## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  #### To clone and run the prototype use the following instructions:
  1. Open up a bash terminal(Linux) or Command Prompt(Windows)
  2. Cone the repository with the code: `git clone https://github.com/SneakyTurtIe/intel-oneAPI.git`
  3. Change the working directory to the deployment directory: `cd intel-oneAPI/Deployment`
  4. Install the requirements of the project with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  5. Run the deployment on localhost using the command: `python main.py`
